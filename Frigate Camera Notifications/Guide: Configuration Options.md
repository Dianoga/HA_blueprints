## Configuration Options Guide

This guide will give more detail about each of the configuration options and provide some troubleshooting tips where appropriate.

### Frigate Camera

This dropdown is automatically filtered to show you just your frigate cameras making the choice very easy. 
The blueprint is meant for one camera, so make other automations for additional cameras. You can also make multiple blueprints for the same camera if you need more flexibility. 

If your dropdown list says "No matching entities found" see this [explanation](https://github.com/SgtBatten/HA_blueprints/issues/12)

This input is mandatory.
